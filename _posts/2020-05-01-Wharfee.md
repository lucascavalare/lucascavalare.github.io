__Wharfee__ is a powerful interactive shell with autocompletion and history. Use [Wharfee](https://github.com/j-bennet/wharfee), 
a Python-based interactive CLI. *Wharfee* is based on `docker-py` and uses a few Python modules to create interactive shell. 

On a Docker host, install Python and the package index command line `pip`. Then install *Wharfee*. For example, on a Ubuntu system:
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install python3.7 python3.7-pip
  $ sudo pip install wharfee
  ```
You are now ready to use this new powerful command-line interface. The commands that you use are exactly the same Docker commands 
but you don't have to use the *docker* prefix. As you type, you get autocompletion suggestions and some syntax highlighting. 
  ```
  $ wharfee                                                      
  Version: 0.10                        
  Home: http://wharfee.com
  wharfee> 
  ```

You also can list `images` from Docker, just perform `images` to the CLI and you'll be prompted to the autocompletion to list options. 
  ```
  wharfee> images
  ```

To start a container, you have to pull an image explictly:
  ```                                                              
  wharfee> pull nginx:latest
  ```
  .
  .
  ```
  wharfee> run -d -p 80:80 nginx:latest

  wharfee> ps
